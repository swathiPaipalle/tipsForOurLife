		<ul>

			<li>
				Use two bowls to cut corn off the cob without getting kernels everywhere.<br>
				Wrap a small bowl in a paper towel (to keep it from slipping) and set upside-down inside a big bowl. A bundt pan works great for this too, if you have it.
			</li>
			<li>Instantly core a head of iceberg lettuce by slamming it down on a cutting board.</li>
			<li>
				Pre-soak pasta and it will cook in about 60 seconds.<br>
				Sounds weird, but it works! Soak the pasta in water in a sealed bag for a couple hours or overnight. Then you can cook it super super fast in boiling water or just add it straight to a hot sauce in a pan and let it finish cooking there.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use a sharp knife (CAREFULLY) to pit an avocado.<br>Safest to put the avocado down on the cutting board first, or maybe invest in some rad chain mail gloves.
			</li>
			<li>Slice avocadoes right in the skin to make neat cubes.Then scoop out the chunks with a spoon.</li>
			<li>Put a dish towel or damp paper towel under your cutting board to keep it from slipping and wobbling.</li>	
			<li>Use a spoon to peel a kiwi from the inside out.</li>
			<li>Cut the ends of the kiwi off, then slide the spoon under the skin around the kiwi.</li>
			<li>
				Grate frozen butter straight into pastry dough for fast, even distribution.<br>This is great for pie, biscuits, and anything else where you want to incorporate butter quickly while it’s still cold.
			</li>
			<li>Hold cherry tomatoes between two plastic lids to slice them all at once.</li>
			<li>Caramelize onions in half the time by adding a little baking soda.</li>
			<li>Microwave an ear of corn and it’ll fall right out of the husk.</li>
			<li>Grate ginger with a microplane instead of mincing it.You can freeze the ginger first to make it firm and easy to grate.</li>
			<li>Coat your cheese grater with nonstick spray for delightfully clean, easy shredding.</li>
			<li>
				Microwave lemons and limes to get more juice out.<br>Zapping citrus for 15 or 20 seconds helps break down carbohydrates in the fruit and encourages maximum liquidity.
			</li>
			<li>Peel a whole head of garlic by shaking it really hard.</li>
			<li>Use an apple slicer to quickly cut potatoes into perfect wedges.</li>
			<li>Freeze meat to make it easier to slice for stir-fries and stews.</li>
			<li>Whip cream by shaking it in a mason jar.And if you keep shaking long enough, you can take it all the way to butter!</li>
			<li>
				Peel lots of boiled eggs at once by shaking them around in the pot.<br>The shells will get broken up and then slip right off when you rinse them. You can also try shaking the eggs in a closed Tupperware container.
